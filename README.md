# Fionna Manager Decompilation
This is a github repo for this games full decomp. I found this game on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpansionHentai/comments/phf8d9/f_someone_made_a_free_little_growth_game/)(NSFW warning) , **I did not make this.**  all credit goes to [@bulumblebee](https://twitter.com/bulumblebee) on Twitter/X. 
### Notes
This requires [Godot version 3.3](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.4-stable/) (I used specifically 3.3.4)
along with android sdk, and opensdk for android compilation.

the apk will give you permission warnings, its safe to ignore it. (or just build it from the source)
## Changes

 - Added Buttons to instantly set maximum stats.
 - a node change for the buttons
 - added an android sdk thingy, idk
 - Fixed bug with reset button (now it resets bust correctly)
 
 ## How I did this
 I found a tool called [gdsdecomp.](https://github.com/bruvzg/gdsdecomp) 
 It decompiles unencrypted Godot games.
after decompiling I just kinda booted it up and tested it out.

if you do not want your games decompiled, read the [godot docs here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_with_script_encryption_key.html)
